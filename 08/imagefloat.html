The granite monolith is one of the world's favorite challenges for rock climbers.  The formation was named "El Capitan" by the Mariposa Battalion when it explored the valley in 1851.</p>

The view looks east into Yosemite Valley including the southwest face of El Capitan, Half Dome, and Bridalveil Falls. This is, to many, the first views of the popular attractions in Yosemite.</p>
