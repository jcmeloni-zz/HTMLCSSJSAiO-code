	<p>Michael's backyard pond is not only a fun hobby but also an ongoing home improvement project that is both creative and relaxing.</p>
	<p>He has numerous fish in the pond, all Koi from various places as far as Japan, Israel, and Australia. Although they don't bark, purr, or fetch anything other than food, these fish are his pets, and good ones at that.</p>
