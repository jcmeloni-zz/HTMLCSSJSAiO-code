      Authors and actors and artists and such<br />
      Never know nothing, and never know much.<br />
      Sculptors and singers and those of their kidney<br />
      Tell their affairs from Seattle to Sydney.

      Playwrights and poets and such horses' necks<br />
      Start off from anywhere, end up at sex.<br />
